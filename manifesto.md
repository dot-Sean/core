# zells - Enabling Software Literacy

**[work in progress]**

- the world of computing is divided into users and creators
- most people can only access a tiny fraction of the power of connected computers
- for a revolution we need wide-spread computer literacy

In order to achieve wide-spread software literacy, we need a tool that is powerful enough to give its user full access to the capabilities of a global network of computers but that is at the same time simple and fun enough to be used by everybody. The goal of *zells* is to be that tool.


## Why do we need software literacy?

### Understanding

- it's everywhere
- it's not magic

### Learning

- the best way to understand something is to replicate it
- in a computer you can replicate everything, even abstract concepts

### Thinking

- externalizing mental models is thinking about thinking
- improves logical thinking

### Collaboration

- we can use dynamic models for discussion
- improve our understanding of the world

### Power

- making computers do your bidding gives you power
- much time is spent on things that could be easily automated


## Why is programming hard?

- programming systems are either limited or complex
- need to remove incidental complexity

### Segregation

- creating a simple program requires complicated tools
- computers are still not used for dynamic learning

### Isolation

- sharing is hard
- pixels and zooming
- web technologies make layouting and programming harder than it needs to be
- need to export files for publishing
- sending files is harder than it should be
- displaying arbitrary files is hard
- need to transform files for different devices
- files need to be manually synchronized between devices
- can't access my environment from other devices
- there are too many messaging providers
- browsers only speak one language
- applications have to be installed
- websites can't integrate with my system

### Interactivity

- files always need to be interpreted
- files are unstructured and it's uncommon to create structure
- PDF cannot be edited (not even move pages)

### Safety

- data loss
- not everybody uses version control
- things need to be explicitly stored to disk

### Security

- fishing, cross site scripting and session hijacking
- passwords
- coarse permissions handling
- most communication is not encrypted with my own key

### Autonomy

- no need to get permission
- consortiums decide what can be done (W3C, Unicode)
- sharing data requires upload to service provider
- publishing anything requires to put the content on someone else's computer
- having to hand over personal data to companies to use their services
- that every service requires a new identity which doesn't belong to me
- my reputation and information does not belong to me

### Set-up

- getting started takes several steps

### Syntax

- authoring software requires learning unnecessary things like syntax

### Discoverability

- how something is done

### Dependencies

- management

### Serialization

- managing memory and persisted data

### Modelling

- thinking about thinking
- complex problems are complex
- logical thinking is hard


## What can we do about it?

### Structured

- Simplification: Only cells
- Identification: Cells have names
- Composition: Cells have children
- Abstraction: Cells inherit from stems

### Dynamic

- Communication: Cells send each other messages
- Reaction: Cells react to messages
- Version: Cells know their past and futures

### Distributed

- Connection: Cells can talk to any other cell in their universe
- Migration: Cells are not bound to hardware
- Concurrency: Cells don't have to wait for other cells

### Secure

- Authentication: Cells use asymmetric keys to identify themselves
- Encryption: Only the receiver can read a message


## How does that make it easier?
