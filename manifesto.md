# zells - a new way of computing

**[work in progress]**

- computers are great
- internet has changed the way we access and distribute information
- but not the way we think and reason like the printing press did

## What's wrong with computing?

### Data silos

- sending files is harder than it should be
- displaying arbitrary files is hard
- need to transform files for different devices
- files need to be manually synchronized between devices
- can't access my environment from other devices
- there are too many messaging providers
- serialization
- consortiums decide what can be done (W3C, Unicode)

### Consumption orientation

- creating a simple program requires complicated tools
- authoring software requires learning unnecessary things like syntax
- pixels and zooming
- files are unstructured and it's uncommon to create structure
- web technologies make layouting and programming harder than it needs to be
- managing memory and persisted data
- not everybody uses version control
- computers are still not used for dynamic learning
- need to export files for publishing
- PDF cannot be edited (not even move pages)

### Centralisation

- sharing data requires upload to service provider
- publishing anything requires to put the content on someone elses computer
- having to hand over personal data to companies to use their services
- browsers only speak one language

### Identity ownership

- that every service requires a new identity which doesn't belong to me
- my reputation and information does not belong to me

### Permission models

- fishing, cross site scripting and session hijacking
- passwords
- coarse permissions handling
- most communication is not encrypted with my own key
- applications have to be installed
- websites can't integrate with my system


## What can we do better?

### Simplification

Only cells

### Identification

Cells have names

### Composition

Cells have children

### Abstraction

Cells inherit from stems

### Communication

Cells send each other messages (which are also cells)

### Reaction

Cells react to messages

### Connection

Cells can talk to any other cell in the universe

### Distribution

Cells are not bound to hardware

### Concurrency

Cells don't have to wait for other cells

### Authentication

Cells use asymmetric keys to identify themselves

### Encryption

Only the receiver can read a message

### Version

Cells know their past and futures


## How does that solve anything?
