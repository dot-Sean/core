# zells - a new way of computing

**[work in progress]**

## Problems

### Data Silos

- sending files is harder than it should be
- displaying arbitrary files is hard
- need to transform files for different devices
- need to export files for publishing
- files need to be manually synchronized between devices
- can't access my environment from other devices
- there are too many messaging providers
- serialization

### Consumption Oriented

- creating a simple program requires complicated tools
- authoring software requires learning unnecessary things like syntax
- pixels and zooming
- files are unstructured and it's uncommon to create structure
- web technologies make layouting and programming harder than it needs to be
- managing memory and persisted data
- not everybody uses version control
- computers are still not used for dynamic learning

### Closed Formats

- consortiums decide what can be done (W3C, Unicode)

### Centralisation

- sharing data requires upload to service provider
- publishing anything requires to put the content on someone elses computer
- having to hand over personal data to companies to use their services
- browsers only speak one language

### Identity Ownership

- that every service requires a new identity which doesn't belong to me
- my reputation and information does not belong to me

### Security

- fishing, cross site scripting and session hijacking
- passwords
- coarse permissions handling
- most communication is not encrypted with my own key
- applications have to be installed
- websites can't integrate with my system


## Solution

### All Objects

### Universal Name Space

### Distribution

### Cryptgraphic Identities
