# Comparing *zells*

The [manifesto](manifesto.md) describes complications of existing software platform in a rather abstract manner. The purpose of this document is to look at a selection of platforms more closely and how certain complications materialize in them.

Restricted by my own knowledge, the list of platforms is all but complete and not every complication is discussed for every platform. Please help improving this document.


## Software Platforms

The list contains a variaty of software and one set of protocols which I all consider to be *platforms*, since they allow users to create their own, new software which is can be accessed or run through the platform.

The categories are *protocols* for platforms that are defined by a standard rather than an implementation. *Operating systems* is everything which is located directly between user and hardware. Everything which could be considered a programming language is categorized under *virtual machines* and everything else is considered an *application*. The lines between the categories are somewhat fluent since it could be argued that some virtual machines behave like operating systems and some applications behave like virtual machines.


## Avoided Complications

The properties that are analysed for each platform are desribed in more detail in the [manifesto](manifesto.md). Each of the following paragraphs describes how a specific complication is avoided in *zells*.

**Segregation**

**Set-Up**

**Syntax**

**Discoverability**

**Interactivity**

**Dependencies**

**Serialization**

**Data Safety**

**Sharing**

**Autonomy**

**Security**
